How do I approach designing software?
Working on this 3D scene project has significantly enhanced my design skills, particularly in visualizing and translating real-world objects into 3D models. I developed a deeper understanding of proportion, spatial arrangement, and perspective, which are essential for effective 3D design. The project also improved my technical skills with OpenGL, especially in handling textures, lighting, and object interactions, providing a solid foundation for future graphics-based work. For my design process, I followed a structured approach: initial concept development, breaking down the scene into manageable components (desk, pencil holder, computer monitor), and then iterating on each element for refinement. I focused on optimizing the scene's rendering performance while ensuring a realistic representation of each object. In future work, the tactics from this design approach such as modularity, iterative development, and balancing technical constraints with aesthetic goals can be applied to create more complex 3D environments or interactive applications.

How do I approach developing programs?

When developing programs, I approach the task by first breaking it down into smaller, manageable components, ensuring a clear understanding of the problem before starting the coding process. I focus on creating modular, reusable code, which helps maintain scalability and maintainability. During my work on the 3D scene project, I employed new development strategies such as prioritizing performance optimization, handling object interactions efficiently, and implementing iterative testing to ensure the accuracy of each element.
Iteration played a crucial role, as I constantly refined and tested each object, ensuring proper scaling, collision detection, and realistic rendering. Initially, I focused on basic structures and then gradually enhanced the complexity, adding textures and refining the lighting.
As I moved through the milestones, my approach to development evolved by incorporating continuous testing and refactoring, which allowed me to improve code quality and implement new features more efficiently, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the project.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is a powerful tool in helping me reach my goals by providing the technical foundation to develop innovative solutions in various fields, including finance, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. The problem-solving, logical thinking, and coding skills I acquire in computer science enable me to design and implement efficient systems that solve real-world problems.
In terms of my educational pathway, computational graphics and visualizations have opened new doors for understanding complex data sets and systems. Learning to represent abstract concepts visually enhances my ability to interpret and communicate information effectively. This skill will be invaluable in my future studies, especially when working on data-heavy projects like statistical modeling or AI.
Professionally, these skills in computational graphics allow me to create engaging, interactive visual representations of data, making it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders. Whether in finance or software development, the ability to visualize data and systems will be crucial in making informed decisions and driving innovation.



Design Decisions document

Throughout the development of the 3D scene project, I made several key design decisions that influenced both the appearance and functionality of the final product. The selection of objects, such as a desk, pen holder, computer monitor, and cup, was aimed at creating a familiar and visually appealing environment. Each object was chosen for its simplicity, allowing me to focus on demonstrating 3D modeling techniques while maintaining a clean and realistic design. The proportions and scale of the objects were carefully considered to ensure they fit together cohesively within the scene, enhancing the overall realism.
To maintain visual clarity, I opted for a simple color scheme, using neutral tones and natural shades for the objects. This decision kept the scene grounded in reality, while avoiding overwhelming the viewer with excessive colors. Initially, I chose not to apply textures to keep the design clean and easy to manage, but later added textures like wood for the desk and reflective surfaces for the monitor to enhance realism.
Lighting was another critical aspect of the design. By using ambient lighting and a soft light source positioned above the desk, I aimed to simulate real-world lighting conditions, creating an inviting atmosphere. Interactivity was also introduced, allowing the user to explore the scene from different perspectives.
The project followed an iterative design process, starting with basic shapes and progressively adding more details. This approach allowed for easy debugging and refinement, ensuring each element functioned correctly before moving on to the next. Moving forward, I plan to improve the scene with more complex interactivity, advanced texturing, dynamic lighting, and animations, further enhancing both realism and user engagement.
